- **9.5** - Bottom sheet modal: ✅ Mobile detection with responsive bottom sheet layout

**Strengths:**
- Outstanding mobile user experience design
- Progressive enhancement with haptic feedback detection
- Responsive design with appropriate touch targets
- Drag distance calculation prevents accidental selections

### ✅ Requirement 10.5: Performance (Lazy Loading) - FULLY COMPLIANT

#### ✅ PASSED Requirements:
- **10.5** - html2canvas lazy loading: ✅ Dynamic script loading with cache and error handling

**Strengths:**
- Efficient caching mechanism prevents duplicate loads
- Graceful error handling with fallbacks
- Detection of existing scripts to avoid conflicts
- Performance-optimized with requestIdleCallback usage

## User Experience Assessment

### Excellent UX Features:
1. **Intuitive Component Overlay**: Clear blue highlighting with informative tooltips
2. **Mobile-First Design**: Bottom sheet modal and haptic feedback enhance mobile experience
3. **Draft Protection**: Automatic draft saving prevents data loss
4. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and focus management
5. **Error Resilience**: Multiple fallback strategies for screenshot capture

### Areas of Excellence:
- Component detection strategy chain provides robust component identification
- CORS handling demonstrates deep understanding of web security constraints
- Mobile interactions are thoughtfully designed with drag distance thresholds
- Performance optimizations with lazy loading and requestIdleCallback

## Critical Issues Resolution

### ✅ ESC Key Handler Fix (RESOLVED)
- **Requirement:** 3.6 - ESC key should exit component selection mode  
- **Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED**
- **Impact:** Accessibility issue resolved - users can now exit selection mode via keyboard
- **Location:** `src/hooks/useComponentDetection.ts` lines 169-178

**Implementation Verified:**
```typescript
// ESC key handler to exit component selection mode (Requirement 3.6)
const handleKeyDown = useCallback((event: KeyboardEvent) => {
  if (!isActive) return;
  
  if (event.key === 'Escape') {
    event.preventDefault();
    event.stopPropagation();
    deactivate();
  }
}, [isActive, deactivate]);
```

**Quality Assurance:**
- ✅ Event listener properly attached when component detection is active
- ✅ Event listener properly removed when component detection is deactivated
