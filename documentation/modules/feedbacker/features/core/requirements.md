# Requirements Document: Core Feedbacker Implementation

## Introduction
This document defines the requirements for implementing the core feedbacker React library - a drop-in feedback system that enables component-level feedback capture during development and design review. The library must be zero-configuration, store all data locally, and provide flexible export options.

### Research Context
Based on POC analysis, the implementation requires careful handling of React fiber structures for component detection, sophisticated touch event management for mobile, and modular architecture to keep bundle size minimal. The library must work across React 18+ applications without any configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Library Initialization
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add the feedback system to my React app with a single import, so that I can start collecting feedback immediately without configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the FeedbackProvider component is imported and added to the app THEN the system SHALL render a floating action button without any required props
2. WHEN the FeedbackProvider is rendered THEN it SHALL NOT interfere with the host application's functionality or styling
3. IF the host application uses React 18 or higher THEN the library SHALL function correctly
4. IF the host application uses React below version 18 THEN the library SHALL display a console warning and disable itself

### Requirement 2: Floating Action Button (FAB)
**User Story:** As a user, I want a persistent button to access feedback features, so that I can provide feedback at any time while using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the FAB is rendered THEN it SHALL appear in the bottom-right corner by default
2. WHEN the FAB is clicked or tapped THEN it SHALL expand to show two actions: "New feedback" and "Show manager"
3. IF a feedback draft exists THEN the FAB SHALL display a visual indicator (dot)
4. WHEN the FAB is clicked while a draft exists THEN it SHALL reopen the minimized feedback modal
5. WHEN the FAB actions are visible and the user clicks outside THEN the actions SHALL collapse

### Requirement 3: Component Detection and Selection
**User Story:** As a user, I want to select specific React components to comment on, so that my feedback is precisely targeted to the right UI element.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN "New feedback" is selected THEN the system SHALL enter component selection mode
2. IF on desktop, WHEN the user hovers over elements THEN the system SHALL highlight React components with a blue outline and component name
3. IF on mobile, WHEN the user touches and drags THEN the system SHALL highlight components under the touch point
4. WHEN a component is selected THEN the system SHALL capture the component name, props, and full component tree path
5. IF component detection fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to "Unknown Component" with DOM element information
6. WHEN in selection mode and the user presses Escape THEN the system SHALL exit selection mode

### Requirement 4: Feedback Modal
**User Story:** As a user, I want to add detailed comments about selected components, so that I can provide context for my feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a component is selected THEN a modal SHALL open with the component information
2. WHEN the modal is open THEN it SHALL display: component name, component path, screenshot preview, and comment textarea
3. WHEN the minimize button is clicked THEN the modal SHALL minimize and return focus to the application
4. IF the modal has unsaved changes and the user tries to close it THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation warning
5. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN it SHALL be saved to localStorage with timestamp and metadata
6. IF the comment field is empty THEN the submit button SHALL be disabled

### Requirement 5: Feedback Manager Sidebar
**User Story:** As a user, I want to review and manage all my feedback before exporting, so that I can ensure quality and completeness.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN "Show manager" is selected from FAB THEN a sidebar SHALL slide in from the right
2. WHEN the sidebar is open THEN it SHALL display all feedback items with thumbnails and truncated comments
3. WHEN a feedback item is clicked THEN it SHALL expand to show full details with edit capabilities
4. WHEN the delete button is clicked on an item THEN it SHALL be removed after confirmation
5. WHEN "Clear all" is clicked THEN all feedback SHALL be removed after confirmation
6. WHEN clicking outside the sidebar THEN it SHALL close

### Requirement 6: Data Persistence
**User Story:** As a user, I want my feedback to persist across page refreshes, so that I don't lose work in progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN it SHALL be saved to localStorage immediately
2. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN all saved feedback SHALL be restored
3. IF localStorage is not available THEN the system SHALL show a warning and continue with session-only storage
4. WHEN localStorage data exceeds 5MB THEN the system SHALL show a warning about storage limits
5. IF corrupted data is detected in localStorage THEN the system SHALL clear it and start fresh

### Requirement 7: Export Functionality
**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my feedback in different formats, so that I can share it through my preferred communication channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the export button is clicked THEN the system SHALL show options for "Text only" and "Full export"
2. WHEN "Text only" is selected THEN the system SHALL generate and download a markdown file without images
3. WHEN "Full export" is selected THEN the system SHALL generate a ZIP file containing feedback.md, feedback.json, and images folder
4. IF export generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with recovery options
5. WHEN feedback is exported THEN the markdown SHALL include component paths, timestamps, and formatted comments

### Requirement 8: Screenshot Capture
**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic screenshots of selected components, so that visual context is preserved with my feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a component is selected THEN the system SHALL capture a screenshot of that component
2. IF screenshot capture fails due to CORS THEN the system SHALL proceed without the screenshot and show a notice
3. WHEN capturing screenshots THEN the system SHALL respect cross-origin policies
4. IF html2canvas is not loaded THEN the system SHALL lazy-load it on first use
5. WHEN screenshots are captured THEN they SHALL be stored as base64 data URLs

### Requirement 9: Mobile Support
**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want touch-optimized interactions, so that I can provide feedback on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN on a mobile device THEN all touch targets SHALL be at least 44x44 pixels
2. WHEN selecting components on mobile THEN the system SHALL use touch-and-drag interaction
3. IF the device supports haptic feedback THEN the system SHALL provide tactile feedback on selection
4. WHEN scrolling during component selection THEN the scroll SHALL be prevented to avoid conflicts
5. WHEN the modal is open on mobile THEN it SHALL use a bottom sheet layout

### Requirement 10: Performance
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the feedback system to have minimal performance impact, so that it doesn't slow down my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the library is loaded THEN the initial bundle SHALL be less than 50KB gzipped (excluding html2canvas)
2. WHEN not in active use THEN the system SHALL have zero performance impact on the host application
3. WHEN scanning for components THEN the detection SHALL use requestIdleCallback or debouncing
4. IF the application has more than 1000 components THEN component detection SHALL remain responsive
5. WHEN html2canvas is needed THEN it SHALL be lazy-loaded on demand

### Requirement 11: Styling Isolation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the feedback system's styles to be isolated, so that they don't conflict with my application's styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the library renders THEN its styles SHALL NOT affect the host application's elements
2. WHEN custom CSS variables are provided THEN the system SHALL use them for theming
3. IF the host application uses CSS-in-JS THEN the feedback system SHALL still render correctly
4. WHEN rendering UI elements THEN all styles SHALL be scoped or use unique class prefixes
5. IF styles conflict with host application THEN the feedback system's UI SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 12: Error Handling
**User Story:** As a user, I want the feedback system to handle errors gracefully, so that issues don't interrupt my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. IF any error occurs in the feedback system THEN it SHALL NOT crash the host application
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN it SHALL be logged to console with a [Feedbacker] prefix
3. IF component detection fails THEN the system SHALL continue with degraded functionality
4. WHEN localStorage operations fail THEN the system SHALL fallback to in-memory storage
5. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative export options or retry

Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design.
